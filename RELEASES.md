# Releases

## 0.9.0

This new release contains so many new features and bug fixes since 0.8.2 that we
decided to make it a new minor release at 0.9.0. 

The release contains many new features. First we did a major 
update of all Gromov-Wasserstein solvers that brings up to 30% gain in
computation time (see PR #431) and allows the GW solvers to work on non symmetric
matrices. It also brings novel solvers for the very
efficient [semi-relaxed GW problem
](https://pythonot.github.io/master/auto_examples/gromov/plot_semirelaxed_fgw.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-gromov-plot-semirelaxed-fgw-py)
that can be used to find the best re-weighting for one of the distributions. We
also now have fast and differentiable solvers for [Wasserstein on the circle](https://pythonot.github.io/master/auto_examples/plot_compute_wasserstein_circle.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-compute-wasserstein-circle-py) and
[sliced Wasserstein on the
sphere](https://pythonot.github.io/master/auto_examples/backends/plot_ssw_unif_torch.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-backends-plot-ssw-unif-torch-py).
We are also very happy to provide new OT barycenter solvers such as the [Free
support Sinkhorn
barycenter](https://pythonot.github.io/master/auto_examples/barycenters/plot_free_support_sinkhorn_barycenter.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-barycenters-plot-free-support-sinkhorn-barycenter-py)
and the [Generalized Wasserstein
barycenter](https://pythonot.github.io/master/auto_examples/barycenters/plot_generalized_free_support_barycenter.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-barycenters-plot-generalized-free-support-barycenter-py).
A new differentiable solver for OT across spaces that provides OT plans
between samples and features simultaneously and 
called [Co-Optimal
Transport](https://pythonot.github.io/master/auto_examples/others/plot_COOT.html)
has also been implemented. Finally we began working on OT between Gaussian distributions and
now provide differentiable estimation for the Bures-Wasserstein [divergence](https://pythonot.github.io/master/gen_modules/ot.gaussian.html#ot.gaussian.bures_wasserstein_distance) and
[mappings](https://pythonot.github.io/master/auto_examples/domain-adaptation/plot_otda_linear_mapping.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-domain-adaptation-plot-otda-linear-mapping-py).

Another important first step  toward POT 1.0 is the
implementation of a unified API for OT solvers with introduction of [`ot.solve`](https://pythonot.github.io/master/all.html#ot.solve)
function that can solve (depending on parameters) exact, regularized and
unbalanced OT and return a new
[`OTResult`](https://pythonot.github.io/master/gen_modules/ot.utils.html#ot.utils.OTResult)
object. The idea behind this new API is to facilitate exploring different solvers
with just a change of parameter and get a more unified API for them. We will keep
the old solvers API for power users but it will be the preferred way to solve
problems starting from release 1.0.0.
We provide below some examples of use for the new function and how to
recover different aspects of the solution (OT plan, full loss, linear part of the
loss, dual variables) :
```python
#Solve  exact ot
sol = ot.solve(M)

# get the results
G = sol.plan # OT plan
ot_loss = sol.value # OT value (full loss for regularized and unbalanced)
ot_loss_linear = sol.value_linear # OT value for linear term np.sum(sol.plan*M)
alpha, beta = sol.potentials # dual potentials

# direct plan and loss computation
G = ot.solve(M).plan
ot_loss = ot.solve(M).value

# OT exact with marginals a/b
sol2 = ot.solve(M, a, b)

# regularized and unbalanced OT
sol_rkl = ot.solve(M, a, b, reg=1) # KL regularization
sol_rl2 = ot.solve(M, a, b, reg=1, reg_type='L2')
sol_ul2 = ot.solve(M, a, b, unbalanced=10, unbalanced_type='L2')
sol_rkl_ukl = ot.solve(M, a, b, reg=10, unbalanced=10) # KL + KL

```
The function is fully compatible with backends and will be implemented for
different types of distribution support (empirical distributions, grids) and OT
problems (Gromov-Wasserstein) in the new releases. This new API is not yet
presented in the kickstart part of the documentation as there is a small change
that it might change
when implementing new solvers but we encourage users to play with it.

Finally, in addition to those many new  this release fixes 20 issues (some long
standing) and we want to thank all the contributors who made this release so
big. More details below.

## 0.8.2

This releases introduces several new notable features. The less important
but most exiting one being that we now have a logo for the toolbox (color
and dark background) :

![](https://pythonot.github.io/master/_images/logo.svg)![](https://pythonot.github.io/master/_static/logo_dark.svg)

This logo is generated using with matplotlib and using the solution of an OT
problem provided by POT (with `ot.emd`). Generating the logo can be done with a
simple python script also provided in the [documentation gallery](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/others/plot_logo.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-others-plot-logo-py).

New OT solvers include [Weak
OT](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.weak.html#ot.weak.weak_optimal_transport)
 and [OT with factored
coupling](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.factored.html#ot.factored.factored_optimal_transport)
that can be used on large datasets. The [Majorization Minimization](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.unbalanced.html?highlight=mm_#ot.unbalanced.mm_unbalanced) solvers for
non-regularized Unbalanced OT are now also available. We also now provide an
implementation of [GW and FGW unmixing](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.gromov.html#ot.gromov.gromov_wasserstein_linear_unmixing) and [dictionary learning](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.gromov.html#ot.gromov.gromov_wasserstein_dictionary_learning). It is now
possible to use autodiff to solve entropic an quadratic regularized OT in the
dual for full or stochastic optimization thanks to the new functions to compute
the dual loss for [entropic](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.stochastic.html#ot.stochastic.loss_dual_entropic) and [quadratic](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.stochastic.html#ot.stochastic.loss_dual_quadratic) regularized OT and reconstruct the [OT
plan](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.stochastic.html#ot.stochastic.plan_dual_entropic) on part or all of the data. They can be used for instance to solve OT
problems with stochastic gradient or for estimating the [dual potentials as
neural networks](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/backends/plot_stoch_continuous_ot_pytorch.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-backends-plot-stoch-continuous-ot-pytorch-py).

On the backend front, we now have backend compatible functions and classes in
the domain adaptation [`ot.da`](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.da.html#module-ot.da) and unbalanced OT [`ot.unbalanced`](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.unbalanced.html) modules. This
means that the DA classes can be used on tensors from all compatible backends.
The [free support Wasserstein barycenter](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.lp.html?highlight=free%20support#ot.lp.free_support_barycenter) solver is now also backend compatible.

Finally we have worked on the documentation to provide an update of existing
examples in the gallery and and several new examples including [GW dictionary
learning](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/gromov/plot_gromov_wasserstein_dictionary_learning.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-gromov-plot-gromov-wasserstein-dictionary-learning-py)
[weak Optimal
Transport](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/others/plot_WeakOT_VS_OT.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-others-plot-weakot-vs-ot-py),
[NN based dual potentials
estimation](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/backends/plot_stoch_continuous_ot_pytorch.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-backends-plot-stoch-continuous-ot-pytorch-py)
and [Factored coupling OT](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/others/plot_factored_coupling.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-others-plot-factored-coupling-py).

## 0.8.1.0
*December 2021*

This is a bug fix release that will remove the `benchmarks` module form the
installation and correct the documentation generation.

#### Closed issues

- Bug in documentation generation (tag VS master push, PR #332)
- Remove installation of the benchmarks in global namespace (Issue #331, PR #333)


## 0.8.1
*December 2021*

This release fixes several bugs and introduces two new backends: Cupy
and Tensorflow. Note that the tensorflow backend will work only when tensorflow
has enabled the Numpy behavior (for transpose that is not by default in
tensorflow). We also introduce a simple benchmark on CPU GPU for the sinkhorn
solver that will be provided in the
[backend](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.backend.html) documentation.

This release also brings a few changes in dependencies and compatibility. First
we removed tests for Python 3.6 that will not be updated in the future.
Also note that POT now depends on Numpy (>= 1.20) because a recent change in ABI is making the
wheels non-compatible with older numpy versions. If you really need an older
numpy POT will work with no problems but you will need to build it from source.

As always we want to that the contributors who helped make POT better (and bug free).

#### New features

- New benchmark for sinkhorn solver on CPU/GPU and between backends (PR #316)
- New tensorflow backend (PR #316)
- New Cupy backend (PR #315)
- Documentation always up-to-date with README, RELEASES, CONTRIBUTING and
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT files (PR #316, PR #322).

#### Closed issues

- Fix bug in older Numpy ABI (<1.20) (Issue #308, PR #326)
- Fix bug  in `ot.dist` function when non euclidean distance (Issue #305, PR #306)
- Fix gradient scaling for functions using `nx.set_gradients` (Issue #309,
  PR #310)
- Fix bug in generalized Conditional gradient solver and SinkhornL1L2
  (Issue #311, PR #313)
- Fix log error in `gromov_barycenters` (Issue #317, PR #3018)

## 0.8.0
*November 2021*

This new stable release introduces several important features.

First we now have
an OpenMP compatible exact ot solver in `ot.emd`. The OpenMP version is used
when the parameter `numThreads` is greater than one and can lead to nice
speedups on multi-core machines.

Second we have introduced a backend mechanism that allows to use standard POT
function seamlessly on Numpy, Pytorch and Jax arrays. Other backends are coming
but right now POT can be used seamlessly for training neural networks in
Pytorch. Notably we propose the first differentiable computation of the exact OT
loss with `ot.emd2` (can be differentiated w.r.t. both cost matrix and sample
weights), but also for the classical Sinkhorn loss with `ot.sinkhorn2`, the
Wasserstein distance in 1D with `ot.wasserstein_1d`, sliced Wasserstein with
`ot.sliced_wasserstein_distance` and Gromov-Wasserstein with `ot.gromov_wasserstein2`. Examples of how
this new feature can be used are now available in the documentation where the
Pytorch backend is used to estimate a [minimal Wasserstein
estimator](https://PythonOT.github.io/auto_examples/backends/plot_unmix_optim_torch.html),
a [Generative Network
(GAN)](https://PythonOT.github.io/auto_examples/backends/plot_wass2_gan_torch.html),
for a  [sliced Wasserstein gradient
flow](https://PythonOT.github.io/auto_examples/backends/plot_sliced_wass_grad_flow_pytorch.html)
and [optimizing the Gromov-Wassersein distance](https://PythonOT.github.io/auto_examples/backends/plot_optim_gromov_pytorch.html). Note that the Jax backend is still in early development and quite
slow at the moment, we strongly recommend for Jax users to use the [OTT
toolbox](https://github.com/google-research/ott)  when possible.
 As a result of this new feature,
 the old `ot.gpu` submodule is now deprecated since GPU
implementations can be done using GPU arrays on the torch backends.

Other novel features include implementation for [Sampled Gromov Wasserstein and
Pointwise Gromov
Wasserstein](https://PythonOT.github.io/auto_examples/gromov/plot_gromov.html#compute-gw-with-a-scalable-stochastic-method-with-any-loss-function),
Sinkhorn in log space with `method='sinkhorn_log'`, [Projection Robust
Wasserstein](https://PythonOT.github.io/gen_modules/ot.dr.html?highlight=robust#ot.dr.projection_robust_wasserstein),
ans [deviased Sinkorn barycenters](https://PythonOT.github.ioauto_examples/barycenters/plot_debiased_barycenter.html).

This release will also simplify the installation process. We have now a
`pyproject.toml` that defines the build dependency and POT should now build even
when cython is not installed yet. Also we now provide pe-compiled wheels for
linux `aarch64` that is used on Raspberry PI and android phones and for MacOS on
ARM processors.


Finally POT was accepted for publication in the Journal of Machine Learning
Research (JMLR) open source software track and we ask the POT users to cite [this
paper](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v22/20-451.html) from now on. The documentation has been improved in particular by adding a
"Why OT?" section to the quick start guide and several new examples illustrating
the new features. The documentation now has two version : the stable version
[https://pythonot.github.io/](https://pythonot.github.io/)
corresponding to the last release and the master version [https://pythonot.github.io/master](https://pythonot.github.io/master) that corresponds to the
current master branch on GitHub.


As usual, we want to thank all the POT contributors (now 37 people have
contributed to the toolbox). But for this release we thank in particular Nathan
Cassereau and Kamel Guerda from the AI support team at
[IDRIS](http://www.idris.fr/) for their support to the development of the
backend and OpenMP implementations.

## 0.7.0
*May 2020*

This is the new stable release for POT. We made a lot of changes in the
documentation and added several new features such as Partial OT, Unbalanced and
Multi Sources OT Domain Adaptation and several bug fixes. One important change
is that we have created the GitHub organization
[PythonOT](https://github.com/PythonOT) that now owns the main POT repository
[https://github.com/PythonOT/POT](https://github.com/PythonOT/POT) and the
repository for the new documentation is now hosted at
[https://PythonOT.github.io/](https://PythonOT.github.io/).

This is the first release where the Python 2.7 tests have been removed. Most of
the toolbox should still work but we do not offer support for Python 2.7 and
will close related Issues.

A lot of changes have been done to the documentation that is now hosted on
[https://PythonOT.github.io/](https://PythonOT.github.io/) instead of
readthedocs. It was a hard choice but readthedocs did not allow us to run
sphinx-gallery to update our beautiful examples and it was a huge amount of work
to maintain. The documentation is now automatically compiled and updated on
merge. We also removed the notebooks from the repository for space reason and
also because they are all available in the [example
gallery](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/index.html). Note that now the
output of the documentation build for each commit in the PR is available to
check that the doc builds correctly before merging which was not possible with
readthedocs.

The CI framework has also been changed with a move from Travis to Github Action
which allows to get faster tests on Windows, MacOS and Linux. We also now report
our coverage on [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/PythonOT/POT) and we have a
reasonable 92% coverage. We also now generate wheels for a number of OS and
Python versions at each merge in the master branch. They are available as
outputs of this
[action](https://github.com/PythonOT/POT/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+dist+and+wheels%22).
This will allow simpler multi-platform releases from now on.

In terms of new features we now have [OTDA Classes for unbalanced
OT](https://pythonot.github.io/gen_modules/ot.da.html#ot.da.UnbalancedSinkhornTransport),
a new Domain adaptation class form [multi domain problems
(JCPOT)](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/domain-adaptation/plot_otda_jcpot.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-domain-adaptation-plot-otda-jcpot-py),
and several solvers to solve the [Partial Optimal
Transport](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/unbalanced-partial/plot_partial_wass_and_gromov.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-unbalanced-partial-plot-partial-wass-and-gromov-py)
problems.

This release is also the moment to thank all the POT contributors (old and new)
for helping making POT such a nice toolbox. A lot of changes (also in the API)
are coming for the next versions.

## 0.6.0
*July 2019*

This is the first official stable release of POT and this means a jump to 0.6!
The library has been used in
the wild for a while now and we have reached a state where a lot of fundamental
OT solvers are available and tested. It has been quite stable in the last months
but kept the beta flag in its Pypi classifiers until now.

Note that this release will be the last one supporting officially Python 2.7 (See
https://python3statement.org/ for more reasons). For next release we will keep
the travis tests for Python 2 but will make them non necessary for merge in 2020.

The features are never complete in a toolbox designed for solving mathematical
problems and research but with the new contributions we now implement algorithms
and solvers from 24 scientific papers (listed in the README.md file). New
features include a direct implementation of the [empirical Sinkhorn
divergence](https://pot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all.html#ot.bregman.empirical_sinkhorn_divergence),
a new efficient (Cython implementation) solver for [EMD in
1D](https://pot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all.html#ot.lp.emd_1d) and
corresponding [Wasserstein
1D](https://pot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all.html#ot.lp.wasserstein_1d). We now
also have implementations for [Unbalanced
OT](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/master/notebooks/plot_UOT_1D.ipynb) and
a solver for [Unbalanced OT
barycenters](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/master/notebooks/plot_UOT_barycenter_1D.ipynb).
A new variant of Gromov-Wasserstein divergence called [Fused
Gromov-Wasserstein](https://pot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all.html?highlight=fused_#ot.gromov.fused_gromov_wasserstein)
has been also contributed with exemples of use on [structured
data](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/master/notebooks/plot_fgw.ipynb) and
computing [barycenters of labeld
graphs](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/master/notebooks/plot_barycenter_fgw.ipynb).


A lot of work has been done on the documentation with several new
examples corresponding to the new features and a lot of corrections for the
docstrings. But the most visible change is a new
[quick start guide](https://pot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) for
POT that gives several pointers about which function or classes allow to solve which
specific OT problem. When possible a link is provided to relevant examples.

We will also provide with this release some pre-compiled Python wheels for Linux
64bit on
github and pip. This will simplify the install process that before required a C
compiler and numpy/cython already installed.

Finally we would like to acknowledge and thank the numerous contributors of POT
that has helped in the past build the foundation and are still contributing to
bring new features and solvers to the library.

## 0.5.0
*Sep 2018*

POT is 2 years old! This release brings numerous new features to the
toolbox as listed below but also several bug correction.

Among the new features, we can highlight a [non-regularized Gromov-Wasserstein
solver](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/master/notebooks/plot_gromov.ipynb),
a new [greedy variant of sinkhorn](https://pot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all.html#ot.bregman.greenkhorn),
[non-regularized](https://pot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all.html#ot.lp.barycenter),
[convolutional (2D)](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/master/notebooks/plot_convolutional_barycenter.ipynb)
and [free support](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/master/notebooks/plot_free_support_barycenter.ipynb)
 Wasserstein barycenters and [smooth](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/prV0.5/notebooks/plot_OT_1D_smooth.ipynb)
 and [stochastic](https://pot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/all.html#ot.stochastic.sgd_entropic_regularization)
implementation of entropic OT.

POT 0.5 also comes with a rewriting of ot.gpu using the cupy framework instead of
the unmaintained cudamat. Note that while we tried to keed changes to the
minimum, the OTDA classes were deprecated. If you are happy with the cudamat
implementation, we recommend you stay with stable release 0.4 for now.

The code quality has also improved with 92% code coverage in tests that is now
printed to the log in the Travis builds. The documentation has also been
greatly improved with new modules and examples/notebooks.

This new release is so full of new stuff and corrections thanks to the old
and new POT contributors (you can see the list in the [readme](https://github.com/rflamary/POT/blob/master/README.md)).

#### Features

* Add non regularized Gromov-Wasserstein solver  (PR #41)
* Linear OT mapping between empirical distributions and 90\% test coverage (PR #42)
* Add log parameter in class EMDTransport and SinkhornLpL1Transport (PR #44)
* Add Markdown format for Pipy (PR #45)
* Test for Python 3.5 and 3.6 on Travis (PR #46)
* Non regularized Wasserstein barycenter with scipy linear solver and/or cvxopt (PR #47)
* Rename dataset functions to be more sklearn compliant (PR #49)
* Smooth and sparse Optimal transport implementation with entropic and quadratic regularization (PR #50)

#### Deprecation

Deprecated OTDA Classes were removed from ot.da and ot.gpu for version 0.5
(PR #48 and PR #67). The deprecation message has been for a year here since
0.4 and it is time to pull the plug.

#### Closed issues

* Issue #35 : remove import plot from ot/__init__.py (See PR #41)
* Issue #43 : Unusable parameter log for EMDTransport (See PR #44)
